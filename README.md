## Captcha solving with OCR

* OpenCV (javacv) for image manipulation (removing noise and creating mask for alphanumerics)
* Tesseract for character recognition

## Current status
* Only 4 captcha images out of 10 are recognised correctly.

## TODO
* Grab more sample images
* Make at least 80% of tests pass
